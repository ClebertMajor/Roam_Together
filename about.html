            <h1> ABOUT US </h1>
            <p>Solo traveling can be an exciting and freeing experience, but it often comes with a sense of loneliness and missed opportunities to share adventures with like-minded people. Many travelers struggle to meet others who share the same interests, destinations, or travel styles while on the road. Social media platforms are too broad, and traditional travel forums lack real-time connection and personalization.

Our website, Roam Together, is designed to bring together people who love to travel. Whether someone is planning a weekend road trip, backpacking abroad, or exploring their own city, the website helps them find travel companions with similar interests and itineraries. By connecting solo travelers with one another, the website creates a supportive community where journeys become more social, fun, and memorable
